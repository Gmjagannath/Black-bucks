    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python is an easy-to-use, beginner-friendly programming language primarily used for web development, application and game development, AI, ML, automation, Software development, GUI development, etc. This section contains a wide range of Python programming examples from basic programs to complex and advanced Python programs.

These examples range from simple Python programs to Mathematical functions, lists, strings, sets, Python dictionaries, tuples, recursions, file handling, classes and objects, linked list, stacks, queues, searching and sorting, trees, heap, graphs, games, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming. Every example program includes the problem description, problem solution, source code, program explanation, and run-time test cases. All Python examples have been compiled and tested on Windows and Linux systems.
